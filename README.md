Using Rust code in a C project â€“ A tale of failure


### What is the point of this?

Embedding Rust code into an existing C project is a really cool idea. This repo is a weird experiment to see how to do that the mots efficiently.

- [x] Call Rust functions from C 
- [x] Use Rust struct in C
- [ ] Link `no_std` crate to C project
- [ ] Use `no_std` dependencies and Rust state in C
